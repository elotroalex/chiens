- {:.centered} ACT I

\textit{(The scene takes place in Saint-Domingue at the time of the French Revolution.)}

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

I say this country is an ulcer.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

I say this land burns.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

I warn you: woe to those who come in contact with its resin.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

I say this country devours, monstrously.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

This country is cursed.\\
This country yawns: a mouth of empty cries, having coughed up Cuba the hookworm. \\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

This country bites: gaping mouth of a flaming throat, flaming fangs converging on America's evil rump.\\

\indent On the margins of bounding tides, I walk on the waters of spinning Springs; I see my sentinel eyes on high. The insomnia grows steadfast like a disobedience along the free temples of the amphora woman---water jug, sprouting tempest jug, kettle.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

My hands untangle my thoughts, creepers without\\
contracture\\
and I salute my brotherhood whole.\\
Saint-Domingue, your rivers sink into my flesh\\
their tamarind snout,\\
forests grow mangles from my muscles,\\
the waves of my blood sing for the cays,\\
I close my eyes,\\
all my riches at hand,\\
all my wetlands,\\
all my volcanoes,\\
my rivers hang on my neck like\\
snakes and precious chains.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\indent Toussaint is standing by the river's rumble... from the golden shore, a hundred warriors throw a hundred spears at him... Toussaint's chest is moonlit with scars...\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\indent Saint-Marc yields... proud... its walls crumble... our horses sniff the blend of gunpowder and drum in the air.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\indent Toussaint, Toussaint, the day of trials has arrived... He comes... the King's messenger comes... he glides... his mouth full of promises... the serpent hisses... hisses... He holds Toussaint on the tip of his tongue...\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\indent Toussaint alone has taken the path of war. All else was quiet. The canons and muskets were quiet. Toussaint is naked... The shield of braided straw in his left hand... He stops... He crawls... He freezes, a knee on the ground... His torso unfolds like a wall... The spear is raised...\\

\textit{(At this moment a magnificent procession crowds the stage: pilgrims, horses, dogs. Scents of musk and benzoin.)}

\begin{center}First Voice of Temptation.\end{center}

My voice rumples words of silk,\\
my voice exhales umbels of feather,\\
my evergreen voice can dig a thousand harmonious songs\\
from the hollow basins\\
my eyelashed voice hones a thousand triumphant insects\\
my voice, a pretty bird aflame with gold\\
with muslin divine, with irresistible desires,\\
my moist voice flows in streams\\
of valorous doves over pebbles\\
of jasper and ecbatana...\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\indent Who goes there, piercing me with silver and gold, besieging me with dangers and strange caresses?\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\indent I've consulted the sacred dice. I say that a royal being slumbers on a narrow bed inside of you.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\indent I say that the Republic has hammered the world a new swing with three golden words...\\

\begin{center}Second Voice of Temptation.\end{center}

\indent Ha, ha, ha. Words, nothing but words---not just three; a thousand words, Toussaint... My dear friend, do you want money? Titles? Land? Would you like to be Field Marshall? Grandee of Spain? King... that's it... you will be King... I swear you will be King.\\

\clearpage

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

I take one step\\
Ah. I take another.\\
Allow me to dislodge the carrion and mud\\
without the insult of your promises.\\

\begin{center}Third Voice of Temptation.\end{center}

\indent ... A king. What an adventure. And it's true that something in you could never be subdued: a rage, a desire, a sadness, an impatience, a contempt; in a nutshell, a violence ... And here your veins carry gold, not mud; pride, not servitude. King, you were once king ...\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

Night feast\\
wine cellar, meat\\
the cleaved houses stitch together a serpent motif\\
fer-de-lance and rose window\\
towns jump like sheep from yellow fever\\
the swollen Artibonite plays the peacock;\\
on the broken dike\\
windows open up ever after.\\
Stop the cruising torture of paradises barred with temptations:\\
a seaside campaign of rum and contraband\\
splits the flat fever of days into nested suns.\\
Damned, may I be damned\\
to catch doublespeak on my tongue. Accomplice.\\
Islands,\\

I was a slave for 50 years\\
and I cut the cane, and I waxed the shoes, and\\
the smallest child, the master's kid,\\
led this gray-haired slave, bound to obedience\\
and respect;\\
and I tell you,\\
that which illuminates the old night of my skull,\\
they are not the images of ambition, no,\\
but the laughter of fire, the laughter of flowers and rivers\\
your image\\
more violent than a heart, more brutal than a thoroughbred\\
oh, Freedom.\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

Bornou Sokoto, Benin and Dahomey Sikasso\\
Sikasso\\
I call to assembly: breasts and sky, mist\\
and pearls, the sowing, the golden keys.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

Martinique, Jamaica\\
no mirage or mountaingem\\

the fire blast, the rotten blood, the steel song\\
fraternal depths of Jericho roses  ...\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} You won't escape your own law.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\indent My law is to run from the unbroken chain, as far as the confluence of fire that vaporizes me, that purifies me and sets me ablaze with my own amalgamated gift.\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

The moon wanes funereal. The king hides.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\indent I don't want to be the grain of perfume wherein the innumerable sacrifices of disarmed roses is summed up and celebrated.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} You will die.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} Alas. You will die.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} So be it, I will die. But naked. Intact.\\
My hand in my own hand, my feet on the ground,\\
what is this dark collapse past drownings and crowds towards the sunset? The world sinks, murdered with smokescreens, caught in the net of its own parentheses.\\
Naked like water,\\
naked like the unicorn gaze of noon,\\
like the scream and the bite, I cleared the low fog\\
from the world without recognition and without ingratitude,\\
where thought does not equivocate, a flower at the heart of a butterfly.\\
I want the naked world of an unstamped universe.\\
A young Fouta girl gnaws at a candelabra bone\\

\clearpage

[8]({{site.baseurl}}/chiens/p008.html)

\indent and I am young. I am plush with youth, with a childhood from long before doors and windows, with a childhood of libations and burnt offerings across my eyes, over the hours. A dry lake hangs on my cheek, but it weeps for the trees of Judea bathed in crocuses and\\
anemones\\
I am naked.\\
I am naked on the stones.\\
I want to die.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} Patience, I'm looking.\\
My polar head swallows the glimmer of corpses, the broken helmets, the inconsolable debris, suns fat with the carnal scent of venison.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\indent I am not a squid. I won't spit night and ink on the night's face.\\
Can you see already? ...\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\indent A terrible, beautiful girl breaks her shell of disasters. Coyote shooters wake up in a merry hut of absinthe.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

Come then, tapered flames, bundle of chills. Let the scent of fire throw its javelin around my head.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} Nothing remains but a lost man,\\
tragic like a palm stump in the stale uprising and the fields of gunpowder. His dusty eyes dart over a steppe with no shade or water---and he chews shade and water---a prayer he won't sell.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\indent Thank you, my sister ... a prayer that he won't sell ... my cobra prayer ... my eel prayer in the forests of the sea ... my cactus milk prayer in the thickets of heaven.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} ... I looked, and the bridges are severed ...\\
The stars have unleashed their sandy scars.\\

Ha, ha\\
We don't see anymore\\
Ha, ha\\
We are blind\\
Blind by the grace of god and fear.\\
Do you see nothing in the new grass?\\
Nothing in the ground's churn and the\\
convulsive frolic of plants?\\
Nothing in the sea, right?\\
I see ... I hear ... I will talk ...\\
Oh, new suction of my blood by the sun\\
vampire,\\
Oh, assault of my rock by the corsair night\\
and my dawn farted below their snouts\\
its crash of midday and gulls\\
Tie me up.\\
Trample me. Assassinate me. Too late.\\
The flushed out hours strike on the lulls\\
and the mooring lanterns;\\
sniffling\\
the hours strike\\
and lengthen with my hands' caresses,\\
the flames lengthen.\\
Me too, I am a flame.\\
I lengthen. I am the hour.\\
I wait for the wind to speak\\
the firebrand tongue in my parched throat.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

It's raining ...\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\indent Toussaint's word is law ... He orders and legislates.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\indent There are no roses: only peppers fasten their red tears.\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\indent Toussaint is king ... He may not have the title, but he is surely king ... a true Lamido ... here is his Guard ... the silver helmets ignite at dusk.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

The king is cold ... The king shivers ... The king coughs.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\indent Alas. Alas. Spiderlike Europe stirs its legs and the phalanges of ships ... Alas. Alas.\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\indent My memories become delirious with incense and bells ... The blue Niger ... The golden Congo ... The sandy Logone ... a gallop of antelopes ... and millet pounders in the cobalt eve.\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} Alas. Alas.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\indent I was awakened from my grand dream of violet seas and chocolate earth, and I saw a small man arrive near the clove trees. He turned the sky black, his face was a peat bog cut with dragonflies.\\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\indent You've heard ... You've heard ... Toussaint is coming. Toussaint puts his feet on the ground ... Toussaint climbs the staircase. Toussaint takes the first step. He makes the second. Toussaint is on the stoop. Step by step, Toussaint sets foot on the ditch camouflaged by slippery smiles ...\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} You won't stop me from speaking to my friends without eclipse\\
Fat moon, bad weed, sycamore, sycamore ...\\
Those are my loves, here are my hatreds\\

\hspace{1cm} I'll bring this country to the knowledge of self\\
I'll acquaint this land with its secret demons\\
I'll light up on craters of cymbals and heloderma\\
the symphonies of an unknown, splendid hell\\
infested with haughty nostalgias ...\\

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

Oh, the king rises.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

And now\\
alone.\\
Everything is alone\\
might as well sharpen my voice\\
all forsakes all\\
my voice toils,\\
my voice sways in the cornet of mists without crossroads\\
and I have no mother\\
and I have no son.\\

No, no, I lie. I'm afraid. I'm alone\\
my forests don't have ears, nor my rivers skin\\
unknown caravels roam the night\\
Is it you, Columbus? Slaveship Captain? Is it you\\
old pirate, old corsair?\\
No response. The scree widens the night.\\
Columbus. Columbus.\\
Answer me, go on, answer me.\\
Beautiful as the shadow lattice of two pythons at noon\\
the archipelago\\
turbulence of prostrate organs\\
sacrifice of glass of lamps crossed on the mouth\\

virulent battle siren, absurdly caught in the motion\\

Columbus. Columbus.\\

\indent Our very presence here is enough to show the magnitude of our desire to seek a resolution.

\indent Hey, Gentlemen, a bit of common sense, please. What the hell. You know what's going on: a full-blown slave rebellion; half of the northern provinces are on fire. Toussaint has constituted an army made up of Blacks from the plantations in Turpin, Flaville, Trêmes, and Noé. And what an army! Makes you shudder.

Our priority now is to stop the Blacks from the western provinces from communicating with the northern rebels. I've set up war camps at Trou, Vallières, Morne, Dondon, la Marmelade and Fort Dauphin.

Enough happiness! The strange beggars with vintage faces who sometimes threaten, sometimes salute the dawns\\
they are me\\
a hunger wakes them up every night among the madrepora\\
- __a hunger for a larger sun and very ancient coins__.
I turn once again to the unknown wind bursting with pursuits\\
I'm leaving\\
don't speak, don't laugh\\
Africa sleeps---don't speak, don't laugh. Africa bleeds, my mother\\
Africa spreads herself open, broken to a stream of vermin,\\
to the sterile invasion of the sperm of rape!\\

What a stretch above the forests, rivers, swamps, tongues and big cats!\\
I do not have the gift of theft.\\
I have no mother---I have no past.\\
I've filled all the way to oblivion, with insults and with dust, the well\\
stepmother of my navel.\\

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\hspace{1cm} I will not give up ... I will not give up on myself.\\
Africa, my innocence ...\\

Look at him, quite the caricature, that crestfallen and scrawny face, a shabby face, chilly hands, the hypocritical chief of a tribe of savages, the sad leader of a demonic race; sneaky schemer, lost among the fanatics.\\
\indent Ladies and Gentlemen, listen carefully ... In 1793 we learned that in the name of human rights, we learned, I repeat, that the most vile of all races was going to sit side by side with us at the banquet of a laughable brotherhood.\\
\indent Ah, we didn't have to wait long to see the results. There was comedy. There was tragedy. There was horror. Cannibals could be seen entering the towns swollen with pride; we lived the Te Deum. We saw constitutions being drafted. We saw all of that, good people in the audience. And what else did we see? The smoke rising at noon; the fire of innumerable Aurora Borealis in the midnight sky, reflecting scenes of crime and absurdity from afar.\\

Toussaint, I am delighted to see you back in a better mood. The consul is sending me to congratulate you, and assure you that your complete submission will not leave him indifferent.\\
