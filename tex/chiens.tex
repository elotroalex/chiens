\begin{verse}
I say this country is an ulcer. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
I say this land burns. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
I warn you: woe to those who come in contact with its resin. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
I say this country devours, monstrously. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
This country is cursed. \\
This country yawns: a mouth of empty cries, having coughed up Cuba the hookworm.  \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
This country bites: gaping mouth of a flaming throat, flaming fangs converging on America's evil rump. \\

\begin{verse}
\indent On the margins of bounding tides, I walk on the waters of spinning Springs; I see my sentinel eyes on high. The insomnia grows steadfast like a disobedience along the free temples of the amphora woman---water jug, sprouting tempest jug, kettle. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
My hands untangle my thoughts, creepers without \\
contracture \\
and I salute my brotherhood whole. \\
Saint-Domingue, your rivers sink into my flesh \\
their tamarind snout, \\
forests grow mangles from my muscles, \\
the waves of my blood sing for the cays, \\
I close my eyes, \\
all my riches at hand, \\
all my wetlands, \\
all my volcanoes, \\
my rivers hang on my neck like \\
snakes and precious chains. \\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent Toussaint is standing by the river's rumble... from the golden shore, a hundred warriors throw a hundred spears at him... Toussaint's chest is moonlit with scars... \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent Saint-Marc yields... proud... its walls crumble... our horses sniff the blend of gunpowder and drum in the air. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent Toussaint, Toussaint, the day of trials has arrived... He comes... the King's messenger comes... he glides... his mouth full of promises... the serpent hisses... hisses... He holds Toussaint on the tip of his tongue... \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent Toussaint alone has taken the path of war. All else was quiet. The canons and muskets were quiet. Toussaint is naked... The shield of braided straw in his left hand... He stops... He crawls... He freezes, a knee on the ground... His torso unfolds like a wall... The spear is raised... \\
\end{verse}

\textit{(At this moment a magnificent procession crowds the stage: pilgrims, horses, dogs. Scents of musk and benzoin.)}

\begin{center}First Voice of Temptation.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
My voice rumples words of silk, \\
my voice exhales umbels of feather, \\
my evergreen voice can dig a thousand harmonious songs \\
from the hollow basins \\
my eyelashed voice hones a thousand triumphant insects \\
my voice, a pretty bird aflame with gold \\
with muslin divine, with irresistible desires, \\
my moist voice flows in streams \\
of valorous doves over pebbles \\
of jasper and ecbatana... \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent Who goes there, piercing me with silver and gold, besieging me with dangers and strange caresses? \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent I've consulted the sacred dice. I say that a royal being slumbers on a narrow bed inside of you. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent I say that the Republic has hammered the world a new swing with three golden words... \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Second Voice of Temptation.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent Ha, ha, ha. Words, nothing but words---not just three; a thousand words, Toussaint... My dear friend, do you want money? Titles? Land? Would you like to be Field Marshall? Grandee of Spain? King... that's it... you will be King... I swear you will be King. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I take one step \\
Ah. I take another. \\
Allow me to dislodge the carrion and mud \\
without the insult of your promises. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Third Voice of Temptation.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent ... A king. What an adventure. And it's true that something in you could never be subdued: a rage, a desire, a sadness, an impatience, a contempt; in a nutshell, a violence ... And here your veins carry gold, not mud; pride, not servitude. King, you were once king ... \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
Night feast \\
wine cellar, meat \\
the cleaved houses stitch together a serpent motif \\
fer-de-lance and rose window \\
towns jump like sheep from yellow fever \\
the swollen Artibonite plays the peacock; \\
on the broken dike \\
windows open up ever after. \\
Stop the cruising torture of paradises barred with temptations: \\
a seaside campaign of rum and contraband \\
splits the flat fever of days into nested suns. \\
Damned, may I be damned \\
to catch doublespeak on my tongue. Accomplice. \\
Islands, \\

\begin{verse}
I was a slave for 50 years \\
and I cut the cane, and I waxed the shoes, and \\
the smallest child, the master's kid, \\
led this gray-haired slave, bound to obedience \\
and respect; \\
and I tell you, \\
that which illuminates the old night of my skull, \\
they are not the images of ambition, no, \\
but the laughter of fire, the laughter of flowers and rivers \\
your image \\
more violent than a heart, more brutal than a thoroughbred \\
oh, Freedom. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
Bornou Sokoto, Benin and Dahomey Sikasso \\
Sikasso \\
I call to assembly: breasts and sky, mist \\

\begin{verse}
\hspace{1cm} You won't escape your own law. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent My law is to run from the unbroken chain, as far as the confluence of fire that vaporizes me, that purifies me and sets me ablaze with my own amalgamated gift. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Chorus.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
The moon wanes funereal. The king hides. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent I don't want to be the grain of perfume wherein the innumerable sacrifices of disarmed roses is summed up and celebrated. \\

\begin{verse}
\hspace{1cm} Alas. You will die. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}Toussaint.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\hspace{1cm} So be it, I will die. But naked. Intact. \\
My hand in my own hand, my feet on the ground, \\
what is this dark collapse past drownings and crowds towards the sunset? The world sinks, murdered with smokescreens, caught in the net of its own parentheses. \\
Naked like water, \\
naked like the unicorn gaze of noon, \\
like the scream and the bite, I cleared the low fog \\
from the world without recognition and without ingratitude, \\
where thought does not equivocate, a flower at the heart of a butterfly. \\
I want the naked world of an unstamped universe. \\
A young Fouta girl gnaws at a candelabra bone \\

\begin{verse}
\indent and I am young. I am plush with youth, with a childhood from long before doors and windows, with a childhood of libations and burnt offerings across my eyes, over the hours. A dry lake hangs on my cheek, but it weeps for the trees of Judea bathed in crocuses and \\
anemones \\
I am naked. \\
I am naked on the stones. \\
I want to die. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{center}The Reciter Woman.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\hspace{1cm} Patience, I'm looking. \\
My polar head swallows the glimmer of corpses, the broken helmets, the inconsolable debris, suns fat with the carnal scent of venison. \\

\begin{verse}
\indent I am not a squid. I won't spit night and ink on the night's face. \\
Can you see already? ... \\

\begin{verse}
\indent A terrible, beautiful girl breaks her shell of disasters. Coyote shooters wake up in a merry hut of absinthe. \\

\begin{verse}
\hspace{1cm} Nothing remains but a lost man, \\
tragic like a palm stump in the stale uprising and the fields of gunpowder. His dusty eyes dart over a steppe with no shade or water---and he chews shade and water---a prayer he won't sell. \\
\end{verse}

Ha, ha \\
We are blind \\
Blind by the grace of god and fear. \\
Do you see nothing in the new grass? \\
Nothing in the ground's churn and the \\
convulsive frolic of plants? \\
Nothing in the sea, right? \\
I see ... I hear ... I will talk ... \\
Oh, new suction of my blood by the sun \\
vampire, \\
Oh, assault of my rock by the corsair night \\
and my dawn farted below their snouts \\
its crash of midday and gulls \\
Tie me up. \\
Trample me. Assassinate me. Too late. \\
The flushed out hours strike on the lulls \\
and the mooring lanterns; \\
sniffling \\
the hours strike \\
and lengthen with my hands' caresses, \\
the flames lengthen. \\
Me too, I am a flame. \\
I lengthen. I am the hour. \\
I wait for the wind to speak \\
the firebrand tongue in my parched throat. \\

\begin{center}The Reciter Man.\end{center}

\begin{verse}
\indent You've heard ... You've heard ... Toussaint is coming. Toussaint puts his feet on the ground ... Toussaint climbs the staircase. Toussaint takes the first step. He makes the second. Toussaint is on the stoop. Step by step, Toussaint sets foot on the ditch camouflaged by slippery smiles ... \\

So, I came to ask you to forgive him. \\
My child is weird, my child is violent; my child wants more; rights. All kinds of rights. Rights that are not made for us. \\
But I'm saying it's not his fault. Humph! I'm saying that his blood is stronger than him; it overcomes him, and plays nasty tricks on him. Humph. And I see that he has infected a bunch of young people with his madness. And it's very unfortunate. A bunch of young protesters. Negroes: they are wrong to demand so much. And no doubt it will bring misfortune. In my day we were more gentle, more accepting, more consenting. Humph. \\

We kept striking among the screams, and the screams grew louder, and a great flame rose pointing east: the commons were burning, and the flame flickered softly on our cheeks.  \\
Then we assaulted the master's house. \\
They fired from the windows. \\
We forced the doors. \\
The master's bedroom was wide open. The master's room was brightly lit, and the master was there very calm ... and we stopped ... It was the master ... I entered. It's you, Toussaint, he told me, very calm ...
