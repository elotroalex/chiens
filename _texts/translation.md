[DRAFT]

The following is an English translation of my own [reading edition]({{site.baseurl}}/texts/reading/) and interpretation of the final authorial stage of the Saint-Dié typescript. My approach to translation is vulgar where it can be: If the original French has a particular effect on me, I bend English to achieve as much, or close. When I can't translate effect, I choose broad legible over arcane literal—except in the case of Caribbean vocabularies—and take liberties to make the English pop.

The drama depends on two tricky binaries: Black/White, and to a lesser extent, Man/Woman. Three temporalities complicate these binaries further for translation: The unfolding drama is based on the Haitian Revolution; it was written for a Martinique audience during the Vichy regime; and, I'm translating for an era of re-ascendant fascism and an American audience knee-deep in our own anti-racist and anti-patriarchal struggle. Césaire's perennial "*nègre*"—the root of Négritude—exemplifies these difficulties. The n-word in English is inexcusable—not least of which—for historical or philological reasons. I mostly chose variations of "black" to highlight the Manichean core of the drama. I use "Negro" in other cases when the white speaker is paternalistic and racist, or ventriloquizing.

*(The scene takes place in Saint-Domingue at the time of the French Revolution.)*

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- I say this country is an ulcer.

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- I say this land burns.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- I warn you: woe to those who come in contact with its resin.

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- I say this country devours, monstrously.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- This country is cursed.
- {:.pr} This country yawns: a mouth of empty cries, having coughed up Cuba the hookworm. 

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- {:.pr} This country bites: gaping mouth of a flaming throat, flaming fangs converging on America's evil rump.

- {:.pr.i} On the margins of bounding tides, I walk on the waters of spinning Springs; I see my sentinel eyes on high. The insomnia grows steadfast like a disobedience along the free temples of the amphora woman---water jug, sprouting tempest jug, kettle.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- My hands untangle my thoughts, creepers without
- contracture
- and I salute my brotherhood whole.
- Saint-Domingue, your rivers sink into my flesh
- their tamarind snout,
- forests grow mangles from my muscles,
- the waves of my blood sing for the cays,
- I close my eyes,
- all my riches at hand,
- all my wetlands,
- all my volcanoes,
- my rivers hang on my neck like
- snakes and precious chains.

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint is standing by the river's rumble... from the golden shore, a hundred warriors throw a hundred spears at him... Toussaint's chest is moonlit with scars...  

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Saint-Marc yields... proud... its walls crumble... our horses sniff the blend of gunpowder and drum in the air. 

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint, Toussaint, the day of trials has arrived... He comes... the King's messenger comes... he glides... his mouth full of promises... the serpent hisses... hisses... He holds Toussaint on the tip of his tongue...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint alone has taken the path of war. All else was quiet. The canons and muskets were quiet. Toussaint is naked... The shield of braided straw in his left hand... He stops... He crawls... He freezes, a knee on the ground... His torso unfolds like a wall... The spear is raised...

*(At this moment a magnificent procession crowds the stage: pilgrims, horses, dogs. Scents of musk and benzoin.)*

- {:.sp} First Voice of Temptation.

- My voice rumples words of silk,
- my voice exhales umbels of feather,
- my evergreen voice can dig a thousand harmonious songs
- from the hollow basins
- my eyelashed voice hones a thousand triumphant insects
- my voice, a pretty bird aflame with gold
- with muslin divine, with irresistible desires,
- my moist voice flows in streams
- of valorous doves over pebbles
- of jasper and ecbatana...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} Who goes there, piercing me with silver and gold, besieging me with dangers and strange caresses?

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} I've consulted the sacred dice. I say that a royal being slumbers on a narrow bed inside of you.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I say that the Republic has hammered the world a new swing with three golden words...

- {:.sp} Second Voice of Temptation.

- {:.pr.i} Ha, ha, ha. Words, nothing but words---not just three; a thousand words, Toussaint... My dear friend, do you want money? Titles? Land? Would you like to be Field Marshall? Grandee of Spain? King... that's it... you will be King... I swear you will be King.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- I take one step
- Ah. I take another.
- Allow me to dislodge the carrion and mud
- without the insult of your promises.

- {:.sp} Third Voice of Temptation.

- {:.pr.i} ... A king. What an adventure. And it's true that something in you could never be subdued: a rage, a desire, a sadness, an impatience, a contempt; in a nutshell, a violence ... And here your veins carry gold, not mud; pride, not servitude. King, you were once king ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Night feast
- wine cellar, meat
- the cleaved houses stitch together a serpent motif
- fer-de-lance and rose window
- towns jump like sheep from yellow fever
- the swollen Artibonite plays the peacock;
- on the broken dike
- windows open up ever after.
- Stop the cruising torture of paradises barred with temptations:
- a seaside campaign of rum and contraband
- splits the flat fever of days into nested suns.
- Damned, may I be damned
- to catch doublespeak on my tongue. Accomplice.
- Islands,

- I was a slave for 50 years
- and I cut the cane, and I waxed the shoes, and
- the smallest child, the master's kid,
- led this gray-haired slave, bound to obedience
- and respect;
- and I tell you,
- that which illuminates the old night of my skull,
- they are not the images of ambition, no,
- but the laughter of fire, the laughter of flowers and rivers
- your image
- more violent than a heart, more brutal than a thoroughbred
- oh, Freedom.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Bornou Sokoto, Benin and Dahomey Sikasso
- Sikasso
- I call to assembly: breasts and sky, mist
- and pearls, the sowing, the golden keys.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Martinique, Jamaica
- no mirage or mountaingem
- can lull to amnesia
- the fire blast, the rotten blood, the steel song
- fraternal depths of Jericho roses  ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.i2} You won't escape your own law.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} My law is to run from the unbroken chain, as far as the confluence of fire that vaporizes me, that purifies me and sets me ablaze with my own amalgamated gift.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- The moon wanes funereal. The king hides. 

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I don't want to be the grain of perfume wherein the innumerable sacrifices of disarmed roses is summed up and celebrated.

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- {:.i2} You will die.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.i2} Alas. You will die.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} So be it, I will die. But naked. Intact.
- My hand in my own hand, my feet on the ground,
- {:.pr} what is this dark collapse past drownings and crowds towards the sunset? The world sinks, murdered with smokescreens, caught in the net of its own parentheses.
- Naked like water,
- naked like the unicorn gaze of noon,
- like the scream and the bite, I cleared the low fog
- from the world without recognition and without ingratitude,
- where thought does not equivocate, a flower at the heart of a butterfly.
- I want the naked world of an unstamped universe.
- A young Fouta girl gnaws at a candelabra bone

- {:.pr.i} and I am young. I am plush with youth, with a childhood from long before doors and windows, with a childhood of libations and burnt offerings across my eyes, over the hours. A dry lake hangs on my cheek, but it weeps for the trees of Judea bathed in crocuses and
- anemones
- I am naked.
- I am naked on the stones.
- I want to die.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.i2} Patience, I'm looking.
- {:.pr} My polar head swallows the glimmer of corpses, the broken helmets, the inconsolable debris, suns fat with the carnal scent of venison.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I am not a squid. I won't spit night and ink on the night's face.
- Can you see already? ...

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} A terrible, beautiful girl breaks her shell of disasters. Coyote shooters wake up in a merry hut of absinthe.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Come then, tapered flames, bundle of chills. Let the scent of fire throw its javelin around my head.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.i2} Nothing remains but a lost man,
- {:.pr} tragic like a palm stump in the stale uprising and the fields of gunpowder. His dusty eyes dart over a steppe with no shade or water---and he chews shade and water---a prayer he won't sell.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} Thank you, my sister ... a prayer that he won't sell ... my cobra prayer ... my eel prayer in the forests of the sea ... my cactus milk prayer in the thickets of heaven.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.i2} ... I looked, and the bridges are severed ...
- The stars have unleashed their sandy scars.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Ha, ha
- We don't see anymore
- Ha, ha
- We are blind
- Blind by the grace of god and fear.
- Do you see nothing in the new grass?
- Nothing in the ground's churn and the
- convulsive frolic of plants?
- Nothing in the sea, right?
- I see ... I hear ... I will talk ...
- Oh, new suction of my blood by the sun
- vampire,
- Oh, assault of my rock by the corsair night
- and my dawn farted below their snouts
- its crash of midday and gulls
- Tie me up.
- Trample me. Assassinate me. Too late.
- The flushed out hours strike on the lulls 
- and the mooring lanterns;
- sniffling
- the hours strike
- and lengthen with my hands' caresses,
- the flames lengthen.
- Me too, I am a flame.
- I lengthen. I am the hour.
- I wait for the wind to speak
- the firebrand tongue in my parched throat.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} My eye gleams with sovereign visions ... Toussaint makes his solemn entry into Santo Domingo ... The Cabildo hands him the keys to the city.

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- It's raining ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint's word is law ... He orders and legislates.

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} There are no roses: only peppers fasten their red tears. 

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint is king ... He may not have the title, but he is surely king ... a true Lamido ... here is his Guard ... the silver helmets ignite at dusk.

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- The king is cold ... The king shivers ... The king coughs.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} Alas. Alas. Spiderlike Europe stirs its legs and the phalanges of ships ... Alas. Alas.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} My memories become delirious with incense and bells ... The blue Niger ... The golden Congo ... The sandy Logone ... a gallop of antelopes ... and millet pounders in the cobalt eve.

[12]({{site.baseurl}}/chiens/p012.html){:.pagetitle}

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} My memories bellow the kidnapping ... the shackle ... the trail in the forest ... the barracoon ... the slave ship ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.i2} Alas. Alas.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} I was awakened from my grand dream of violet seas and chocolate earth, and I saw a small man arrive near the clove trees. He turned the sky black, his face was a peat bog cut with dragonflies.

- {:.sp} The Man Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} You've heard ... You've heard ... Toussaint is coming. Toussaint puts his feet on the ground ... Toussaint climbs the staircase. Toussaint takes the first step. He makes the second. Toussaint is on the stoop. Step by step, Toussaint sets foot on the ditch camouflaged by slippery smiles ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} You won't stop me from speaking to my friends without eclipse
- Fat moon, bad weed, sycamore, sycamore ...
- Those are my loves, here are my hatreds
- and my voice a very wise child by your alcove.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- {:.i2} Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} The idiomless river tires of the maneuvers of ash;
- the cape and the filings
- the birds and the days
- turn with a lock's creak;
- fantastic animals on the infantile horizon
- brain grazers
- rest their eyes now
- giddy from the night drunk whole.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- {:.i2} Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- I want to populate the night with a meticulous goodbye.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Violets and anemones rise at each step of my blood.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(farther away.)*

- Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- ... at each step of my voice, with each drop of my name.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(even farther away.)*

- ... Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- ... araucaria cones, cherry bouquets.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(almost lost in the distance.)*

- Oh, the king rises.

- Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} I'll bring this country to the knowledge of self
- I'll acquaint this land with its secret demons
- I'll light up on craters of cymbals and heloderma
- the symphonies of an unknown, splendid hell
- infested with haughty nostalgias ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- And now
- alone.
- Everything is alone
- might as well sharpen my voice
- all forsakes all
- my voice toils,
- my voice sways in the cornet of mists without crossroads 
- and I have no mother
- and I have no son.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Oh, the king rises.

- Desire
- desire

- first face of the world
- sedition of long centuries

[16]({{site.baseurl}}/chiens/p016.html){:.pagetitle}

- No, no, I lie. I'm afraid. I'm alone
- my forests don't have ears, nor my rivers skin
- unknown caravels roam the night
- Is it you, Columbus? Slaveship Captain? Is it you
- old pirate, old corsair?
- No response. The scree widens the night.
- Columbus. Columbus.
- Answer me, go on, answer me.
- Beautiful as the shadow lattice of two pythons at noon
- the archipelago
- turbulence of prostrate organs
- sacrifice of glass of lamps crossed on the mouth
- of tempests
- virulent battle siren, absurdly caught in the motion
- of palms and scolopendra
- it's me tonight, swearing before the assembled forest
- in rings of violent cries
- Columbus. Columbus.

- {:.sp} 1st Deputy.

- {:.pr.i} Our very presence here is enough to show the magnitude of our desire to seek a resolution. We have silenced the natural indignation in our hearts that the memory of so many acts of cruelty has aroused. And we have swept under the rug all of our revulsion and repulsion, all the customs that our philosophical minds call bias or prejudice, even though these are the binding forces of our colonial societies ...

Toussaint has constituted an army made up of Blacks from the plantations in Turpin, Flaville, Trêmes, and Noé. And what an army! Makes you shudder.

- Just like me, your master will bleed one day:

- prisoner of my Africa, like me of his Europe.
- Africa is now linked to its destiny ...
- Africa has a share with him
- Toussaint a share with him, whether he likes it or not.
- I say that Africa will not let go ...

- the glimmer of steel nests in their cold eyes.

- over 306 years
- Too late, it's too late
- my friends, I'm not here for anyone

- except for the flood, too waterlogged to reflect the stars
- except for the mud with burnt eyes and burnt sex
- girls run around inside my eyes rattled by alfalfa
- clacking their river clogs
- their dustless tree voices

- a herd of wild buffaloes

- {:.pr} Today is a day of connivance. There are bitter days on my lips, and the small mango that falls, falls lugubriously, and the flowers look like burials that respond more and more feebly, but I am at peace today, and the blind she-oak signals me, and the sea smiles at me with all its dimples, and every manchineel bends and commits suicide from the propitious olive tree.
- {:.i2} Welcome, day of trials.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- Toussaint Louverture.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Well, here you are, worthy messenger of the superior race
- {:.pr} Full of flair, having smelled the scent of nearby treasure, our masters here have asked you to receive the revelation of our little secrets ... It's fine ... The civet does not hasten on the steps of the gazelle.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- {:.pr} Toussaint, I am delighted to see you back in a better mood. The consul is sending me to congratulate you, and assure you that your complete submission will not leave him indifferent.
- {:.pr} In any case, let me point out that you do not underestimate yourself: your ransom is worth a considerable treasure.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- ... Considerable ... the treasure of the old buccaneers fattened by my foresight.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- Well, Toussaint.

- {:.pr} Let's see, Toussaint, you lost the battle. You are defeated: there is no dishonor in recognizing it.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Toussaint is conquered; the spirit of Toussaint is not.
- He still animates thousands of wills
- You see those hills bloated with the menace of rough-necked men?
- The revolt ... my sons, those are my sons.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- It was a November night.
- We crawled through the sugarcane
- The cutlasses laughed at the stars, but we weren't thinking about the stars.
- The sugarcane scarred our faces with a rush of green blades
- We crawled, cutlasses in hand
- Suddenly, howls broke the silence.
- {: .pr} We had jumped, we slaves, we dunghill, we beasts with patient hoofs. We ran like madmen. The gunshots rang ... We were striking them down ... The sweat and the blood kept us fresh.
- {: .pr} We kept striking deep in the screams, and the yelling grew louder, and a great flame rose from the east: the commons were burning, and the flame flickered softly on our cheeks.
- Then we assaulted the master's house.
- We fired at the windows.
- We forced the doors.
- {: .pr} The master's bedroom was wide open. The master's room was brightly lit, and the master was very quiet ... and we stopped ... It was the master ... I entered. It's you, Toussaint, he told me, very calm ... It was me, it was me, I told him, the good Toussaint, the faithful Toussaint, his slave Toussaint, Toussaint, Toussaint Louverture, and suddenly his eyes became two frightened cockroaches on a rainy day ... I swung, the blood spurted. This is the only baptism I remember.

- Maybe then, father, it's my turn to complain.
- {: .pr} When the Republic offered you to raise me in Europe, the bells of your heart were ringing with joy.

- And the cold, injected down to the vein.
- {: .pr} But time passed. I found a certain peace, something like fibers untwisting, and the landscape was sweet, maternal, like a reflection on the water, and it had a measure, a decency, a restraint, along with an abandonment, the landscape, a friendship at last ... my blood no longer cursed, something like an undoing and a blooming.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr} not so for me, the landscape poisons me with aconites from its alphabet. I too can read and the cloud is shaped like the head of that old Negro I saw on the breaking wheel in a square in Cape Town; he slapped a White man, I was 10 years old; the low sky is a damper, the wind swells with burdens and the sobs of sweating skin, the wind is contaminated with whips and casks, and hung men populate the sky with orchis, and I see the mastiffs with bloody hair and ears ... ears ... boats

- And now the living past gets back its leaves
- the past rips like a banana leaf.
- Isaac, Isaac

- random fables,

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Who is this woman?

- {:.sp} The Guard Woman.

- Ouch! The sexist pig! He insults me, the bastard. He insults me, you hear?

- {:.sp} The Guard Man.

- Insolent, disgusting, libidinous monkey!

*(The man hits him. The woman hits him too.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr} Strike ... strike, commander ... strike for blood ... born from the furrow, a race without moan ... strike and tire yourself.

- {:.sp} The Guard Woman.

- {: .pr} Chump! What a chump! This is a chump I tell you ... a strange race, these Negroes ... Do you think our blows hurt him ... in any case, it doesn't leave a mark.

- {:.sp} The Prison Guard  *(laughing.)*

- Everyone knows: a good smacking does a Negro good ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr} Isaac, Isaac, why stay in the rain ... I had a son ... I managed to protect him from the bites of this race of scorpions ... Isaac, Isaac!

- {:.sp} The Guard Man.

- {: .pr} Ah! he is seriously going off the rails ... I could die laughing ... Say, it's weird, the red blood on the black skin. *(They loosen Toussaint.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint *(jumping up.)*

- cut hands ... brain leak ... soft carrion ... Isaac,
- Isaac ... why stay in the rain with the poisonous scorpions?
- {: .pr} the anteaters lost in time lapping aquamarine ants on city pavements. The opossums seek a red tree, a silver tree between the joints of the equinox ... a will convulses in the mastic, muddied by fatalities and the hide-and-seek of glow worms. Isaac! Isaac! 

*(He collapses moaning.)*

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {: .pr} What a night! the snow! As if the night and the snow were caught in mortal combat: large shadow masses bring down the panel of the sky, and the cavalry of flakes rushes down in the whipped flight of its one hundred thousand burnous.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {: .pr} Amen! the snow bites; the snow sinks its burning fangs on a solemn night.

*(At this moment a vision of an endless white road: a lantern flickers; a form slowly appears. It is The Holy Virgin. She walks forward, stops and looks at Toussaint, who she contemplates at length.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Humph! What is it ? Who wakes me up?
- Who comes to trouble me at the doorsteps of rest?

- {:.sp} The Holy Virgin.

- {:.sp} The Holy Virgin.

- {:.i2} My son, my son.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr.i} I am not your son. I am the son of the Earth however, the brother of the Sun however, the brother of the Night and its millions of stars however. I am not your son ... I'm afraid ... my throat burns. Mother! Mother!

- {: .pr.i} And when we were tired, broken, exhausted, crushed, our only julep and balm the sneer of the whip, the barking whip and the wild bite, and acid dripping on our flesh, brutalized with humiliation. Thanks, mom. 
- {: .pr.i} And they needed---didn't they?---those who sent you, they needed more than my defeat, more than my breasts breaking, more than my blood decomposing, they needed my acceptance ... they needed my yes, and then they sent you ... go away, stepmother ... I despise you, go away ... leave empty handed ... or rather, take this bag of words ... the words of Toussaint, the last perhaps, the last ... no doubt, and bring them to your filthy brood.
- {: .i2} Oh, white men, my brothers
- our twisted specters will come to haunt your banquets
- {: .pr} dressed in rags, obscene, in the midst of your celebration, our scandalous faces,
- our shouts will disturb your victories
- {: .pr} and in the nights of defeat, you will see us standing at your crossroads, Black, terrible, silent ... and you will be ashamed ... and you will be afraid ... 

*(The vision gradually disappears.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint *(haggard)*

- {: .pr} ... A rumor of chains of shackles rises from the sea ... a gurgling of those drowned on the green belly of the sea ... a lash of fire, a crack of the whip, the cries of the murdered ...
- ... the sea burns
- or the tow in my blood burns ...
- {: .pr} Oh, the cry ... always that fanning howl from the mountains ... and the rut of fire and drums, and the wind swells in vain with the soft smells of a musty ravine, of breadfruit trees

King of Malaysia and fevers full of insects, chew your kris and your betel ... Isaac, Isaac, a bullet rusts on your White smile ... Ouch! I walk on starfish thorns. I walk ... I assume ...

- {:.pr.i} Saint-Domingue, the secrets locked under a throat turn up in the blood steeple. Possessed women lay their soapy hands in the four corners of the red-heart marsh; the new thirsts flow out, broken moons right on the water loaf, a stone on the forehead.

- {:.sp} The Woman Reciter.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

*(The scene has changed abruptly. We are in Saint-Domingue, the walls of Le Cap are besieged by the Black army of Dessalines ... cannon shots ... fumes ... pieces of collapsed wall ... a Black General on horseback is surrounded by a large number of officers ... armed troops ready to move.)*

- caterpillars roared on the bridge

- and the broken moats answered with revenge
- with her barbs of stars
