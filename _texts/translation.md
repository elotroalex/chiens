[DRAFT]

The following is an English translation of my own [reading edition]({{site.baseurl}}/texts/reading/) and interpretation of the final authorial stage of the Saint-Dié typescript. My approach to translation is vulgar where it can be: If the original French has a particular effect on me, I bend English to achieve as much, or close. When I can't translate effect, I choose broad legible over arcane literal—except in the case of Caribbean vocabularies—and take liberties to make the English pop.

The drama depends on two tricky binaries: Black/White, and to a lesser extent, Man/Woman. Three temporalities complicate these binaries further for translation: The unfolding drama is based on the Haitian Revolution; it was written for a Martinique audience during the Vichy regime; and, I'm translating for an era of re-ascendant fascism and an American audience knee-deep in our own anti-racist and anti-patriarchal struggle. Césaire's perennial "*nègre*"—the root of Négritude—exemplifies these difficulties. The n-word in English is inexcusable—not least of which for historical or philological reasons—and is often found in translations of Césaire to provide a perverse excuse for non-black Americans to indulge in reading it out loud. I mostly chose variations of "black" to highlight the manichean core of the drama. I use "negro" in other cases when the speaker is paternalistic and racist, or ventriloquizing. I translate the feminine "*La Récitante*," which has no equivalent in English, to "The Narrator," while using "The Reciter" for the masculine "*Le Récitant*."

- This country is cursed.
- {:.pr} This country yawns: having spat the hookworm Cuba, a mouth of empty clamor. 

- {:.sp} The Reciter.

- {:.pr} This country bites: the gaping mouth of a fire throat, fire fangs converging on the ass of America the shitty.

- {:.pr.i} By the bounding tides, I march on the water of spinning Springs; I see my sentinel eyes on high. The insomnia grows steadfast like a disobedience along the free temples of the woman with amphora—water jug, sprouting tempest Acquarius, kettle.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- My hands dig out my thoughts, creepers without
- cramps
- and I salute my fraternity whole.
- Saint-Domingue, your rivers sink into my flesh
- their tamarin snout,
- forests grow mangles on my muscles,
- waves of my blood sing for the cays,
- I close my eyes,
- all my riches at hand,
- all my wetlands,
- all my volcanos,
- my rivers hang on my neck like
- snakes and precious chains.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} Who goes there, injecting me with silver and gold, besieging me with dangers, with unknown caresses?

- {:.sp} The Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} I've consulted the sacred dice. I say that a royal being, sleeping on a narrow bed, lives inside of you. 

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I say that the Republic has rung the world a new swing by hammering three golden words ...

- {:.sp} Second Voice of Temptation.

- {:.pr.i} Ha, ha, ha. Words, nothing but words—not only three; a thousand words, Toussaint ... My dear friend, do you want money? Titles? Land? Would you like to be field marshall? Grandee of Spain? King ... that's it ... you will be King ... I swear you will be King.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- I take one step
- Oh. I take another.
- leave me without the insult of your promises, to swallow
- carrion and mud. 

- {:.sp} Third Voice of Temptation.

- {:.pr.i} ... A king. What an adventure. And it's true that something in you could never be subjected: a rage, a desire, a sadness, an impatience, a contempt, in a nutshell, a violence ... And here your veins carry gold, not mud; pride, not servitude. King, you were once king ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Night feast
- wine cellar, meat
- the cleaved houses spin their serpent cut-outs
- fer-de-lance and rose window
- the towns bounce like lambs with yellow fever
- the swollen Artibonite plays the peacock;
- on the broken dike
- the windows open unto always
- stop the cruising torture of paradises barred with temptations:
- a seaside campaign of rum and contraband
- splits the flat fever of days with nested suns.
- Cursed, may I be cursed.
- To catch half a word on the tongue. Accomplice.
- Islands,

- I was a slave for 50 years
- and I have cut the cane and I have waxed the shoes and
- the smallest child (the master's kid)
- drove the old slave chained to obedience
- and respect;
- and I tell you,
- those which light the old night in my head,
- are certainly not the images of ambition, no,
- but the laughter of fire, the laughter of flowers and rivers
- your image
- more violent than a heart, more brutal than a thoroughbred
- oh, Freedom.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Bornou Sokoto, Benin and Dahomey Sikasso
- Sikasso
- I call to assembly: skies and breasts, drizzle
- and pearls, the sowing, the golden keys.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Martinique, Jamaica
- all mirages and mountaingems
- cannot lull to amnesic sleep
- the fire blast, the spoils of blood, the steel song
- fraternal abysses of the roses of Jericho ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.i2} You won't escape your own law.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} My law is to run from a chain with no broken link, as far as the confluence of fire that detonates me, where my own alloyed gift distills and ignites me.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- The moon wanes funereal; the king hides. 

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I don't want to be the grain of perfume where the innumerable sacrifices of unarmed roses become celebrated and succint.

- {:.sp} The Reciter.

- {:.i2} You will die.

- {:.sp} The Narrator.

- {:.i2} Alas. You will die.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} So be it, I will die. But naked. Intact.
- One hand on the other, my feet on the ground,
- {:.pr} what is this dark collapse towards the sunset through drownings and crowds? The world sinks, murdered with smoke screens, caught in the net of its own parentheses.
- Naked like water,
- naked like the unicorn gaze of noon,
- like the scream and the bite, I cleared the low fog
- from the world, without gratitude or ingratitude,
- where thought does not equivocate, a flower with the heart of a butterfly.
- I want a naked world and an unstamped universe.

- A young Fouta girl gnaws at a chandelier bone.

- {:.pr.i} And I am young. I am plush with youth, with a childhood prior to doors and windows, with a childhood of libations and offerings over my eyes, over the hours. A dry lake hangs on my cheek, but it weeps for the trees of Judea bathed in crocuses and
- anemones
- I am naked.
- I am naked on the stones.
- I want to die.

- {:.sp} The Narrator.

- {:.i2} Patience, I see.
- {:.pr} My polar head engulfs the glimmer of corpses, the broken helmets, the inconsolable debris, the suns oozing the beefy scent of venison.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I am not an octopus. I won't spit night and ink on the face of the night.
- Do you see now? ...

- {:.sp} The Narrator.

- {:.pr.i} A terrible, beautiful girl breaks her shell of disasters. Coyote hunters wake up in a happy absynthe hut.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Come then, tapered flames, bundle of chills. Let the fire scents throw their javelin over my head.

[9]({{site.baseurl}}/chiens/p009.html){:.pagetitle}

- {:.sp} The Narrator.

- {:.i2} Nothing remains but a lost man,
- {:.pr} tragic like a palm stump in the trite riot and the fields of gunpowder. His dusty eyes dart into a steppe without shade and water—and he chews shade and water—a prayer that he will not sell.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} Thank you, my sister ... a prayer that he will not sell ... my cobra prayer ... my eel prayer in the forests of the sea ... my cactus milk prayer in the halls of the sky.

- {:.sp} The Narrator.

- {:.i2} ... I did see, and the bridges have fallen ...
- The stars have unleashed their scars of sand.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Ha, ha
- We don't see anymore
- Ha, ha
- We are blind
- Blind by the grace of god and fear.
- Do you see nothing in the new grass?
- Nothing in the ground's churn and the
- Convulsive heckling of plants?
- Nothing in the sea, really?
- I see ... I hear ... I will talk ...
- Oh, the vampire sun sucks my blood again,
- Oh, the corsair night assaults my rock
- and my dawn farts below their faces
- its crash of midday and gulls
- Tie me.
- Trample me. Assassinate me. Too late.
- The flushed out hours ring on the lulls 
- and the mooring lanterns;
- all sniffs
- the hours ring
- and spread out at the brush of my fingers,
- the flames spread out.
- Me too, I am a flame.
- I spread out. I am the hour.
- I wait for the wind to speak
- the firebrand tongue in my deep-dried throat.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} My eye gleams with sovereign visions ... Toussaint makes his solemn entry into Santo Domingo ... The cabildo hands him the keys to the city.

- {:.sp} The Reciter.

- It rains ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint's wishes are commands ... He orders and legislates.

- {:.sp} The Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} There are no roses: only peppers stitching their red tears. 

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint is king ... He may not have the title, but he is surely king ... a true Lamido ... here is his guard ... the silver helmets ignite at dusk.

- {:.sp} The Reciter.

- The king is cold ... The king shivers ... The king coughs.

- {:.sp} The Narrator.

- {:.pr.i} Alas. Alas. Spider Europe stirs its legs and phalange of ships ... Alas. Alas.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} My memories become delirious with incense and bells ... The blue Niger ... The golden Congo ... The sandy Logone ... a gallop of antelopes ... and millet pounders in the cobalt eve.

[12]({{site.baseurl}}/chiens/p012.html){:.pagetitle}

- {:.sp} The Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} My memories bellow the kidnapping ... the shackle ... the trail in the forest ... the barracks ... the slave ship ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.i2} Alas. Alas.

- {:.sp} The Narrator.

- {:.pr.i} I was awakened from my grand dream of violet seas and chocolate earth, and I saw a small man arrive this side of the clove trees. He turned the sky black, his face a peat bog cut with dragonflies.

- {:.sp} The Reciter.

- {:.pr.i} You have heard ... You have heard ... Toussaint comes. Toussaint puts his feet on the ground ... Toussaint begins his climb up the staircase. Toussaint crosses the first step. He mounts the second. Toussaint is on the perron. Step by step, Toussaint sets foot on the ditch cloaked in slippery smiles ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} You won't stop me from speaking to my friends without eclipse
- Fat moon, bad weed, sycamore, sycamore ...
- These are my loves, here are my hates
- and my voice a wise child at the edge of your alcove.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- {:.i2} Oh, the king stands.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} The river without idiom is exasperated by the maneuvers of the ash;
- the cape and the filings
- the birds and days
- turn, their doorknob creaks;
- the fantastic animals on the childish horizon
- brain grazers
- have averted
- their eyes
- playful from all that drunk night

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- {:.i2} Oh, the king stands.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- I want to populate the night with a meticulous goodbye.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- Oh, the king stands.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Violets and anemones rise at each step of my blood.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(farther away.)*

- Oh, the king stands.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- ... at each step of my voice, with each drop of my name.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(even farther away.)*

- ... Oh, the king stands.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- ... araucaria fruit, cherry bouquets.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(almost lost in the distance.)*

- Oh, the king stands.

- Oh, the king stands.

- {:.i2} I'll make this country to know itself
- I'll acquaint this land with its secret demons
- I'll light up the craters with cymbals and heloderma
- the symphonies of an unknown hell, splendid
- infested with haughty nostalgias ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Oh, the king stands.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- And now
- alone.
- Everything is alone
- I sharpen my voice
- all deserted all
- my voice barely,
- my voice sways in the cornet of mists without crossroads 
- and I don't have a mother
- and I don't have a son.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Oh, the king stands.

[16]({{site.baseurl}}/chiens/p016.html){:.pagetitle}

- No, no, I lie. I'm afraid. I'm alone
- my forests don't have ears, nor my rivers skin
- unknown caravels roam the night
- Is it you, Columbus? Captain of the slaveship? Is it you
- old pirate, old corsair?
- No response. The scree widens the night.
- Columbus. Columbus.
- Answer me, go on, answer me.
- Beautiful as the shadow lattice of two pythons at noon
- the archipelago
- turbulence of prostrate organs
- sacrifice of lamp glass crossed on the mouth
- of tempests
- virulent battle siren absurdly caught in the motion
- of palms and scolopendra
- it's me tonight, swearing before the assembled forest
- in rings of violent cries
- Columbus. Columbus.

- {:.pr.i} Our presence alone signals how earnest is our desire to reconcile. We have silenced in our hearts the natural indignation aroused by the memory of so many acts of cruelty.

- {:.sp} The Governor.

- {:.pr.i} Hey, Gentlemen, common sense, please. What the hell. You know what's going on: a full-blown slave rebellion; half of the North province is on fire. Toussaint has built an army with the Blacks from the Turpin, Flaville, Trêmes, and Noé plantations. And what an army! I shudder. Our women are suffering the latest outrages; they are impaling the children; planters are being sawn alive on planks.

We attack the slaves who have remained faithful. We attack the free men of color. Several of them have already been massacred.

- {:.pr.i} I see, gentlemen, that you haven't understood. This is no time for deliberation. I made my decision. The priority now is to stop the Blacks of the West province from communicating with the Nord insurgents. I've set up war camps at Trou, Vallières, Morne, Dondon, la Marmelade and Fort Dauphin. As far you're concerned, Gentlemen, prepare for battle, and long live the French colony of Saint-Domingue.

- {:.pr} Twilight hesitated shivering and fragile among the crickets scrapers of metal.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- Toussaint Louverture.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Who's calling me ? I listen. I do not listen.
- {:.pr} There is in my head a river of mud of bleak of green and troubled things of dead birds, yellow bellies,
- crisscrossed miaowings squirts very close to the gag
- my convulsed years painted on fire
- revolving plaques of swamps, craters, raped girls
- there in my ears the firing squad in the morning caponiers.

- I fear nothing. I have no fear, my friends.
- {:.pr} Today is a day of connivance. There are bitter days on my lips and the small mango that falls, falls lugubriously, and the flowers look like burials that respond more and more feebly, but today I am at peace, and the blind she-oak signals me, and the sea smiles at me with all its dimples and every manchineel doubles up and commits suicide from the propitious olive tree.
- {:.i2} Welcome, day of trials.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- Toussaint Louverture.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Well, here you are, worthy messenger of the superior race
- {:.pr} Full of flair, having smelled the smell of nearby treasure, our masters here have delegated to you to hear the revelation of our little secrets ... It's all good ... The civet does not hasten on the steps of the gazelle.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- {:.pr} Toussaint, I am delighted to see you back in a better mood. The consul is sending me to congratulate you, and assure you that your complete submission will not leave him indifferent.
- {:.pr} In any case, let me point out that you do not underestimate yourself: your ransom is worth a treasure.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- ... Considerable ... the treasure of the old buccaneers fattened by my foresight.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- Well, Toussaint.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- {:.pr} Let's see, Toussaint, you lost the battle. You are defeated: there is no dishonor to recognize it.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Toussaint is conquered; the spirit of Toussaint is not.
- He still animates thousands of wills
- Do you see the hills bloated with the menace of rough-skinned men?
- The revolt ... my sons, these are my sons.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- {:.i2} Your childish imaginations make me smile with pity.
- Your sons. Naive old man.

- We crawled through the sugar cane
- The cutlasses were laughing at the stars. They were making fun of the stars.
- The sugar cane scarred our faces of streams of green blades
- We crawled cutlass in hand
- Suddenly the ruckus broke the silence.
- {: .pr} We had jumped, we slaves, we dunghill, we beasts with patient hoofs. We ran like madmen. The gunshots burst ... We were striking ... The sweat and the blood kept us fresh.
- {: .pr} We were striking among the cries and the shouts became more strident and a great flame rose from the east: it was the commons burning and the flame flickered softly on our cheeks.
- Then we assaulted the master's house.
- We fired at the windows.
- We forced the doors.
- {: .pr} The master's bedroom was wide open. The master's room was brightly lit, and the master was very quiet ... and we stopped ... It was the master ... I entered. It's you, Toussaint, he told me, very calm ... It was me, it was me, I told him, the good Toussaint, the faithful Toussaint, his slave Toussaint, Toussaint, Toussaint Louverture, and suddenly his eyes were two frightened cockroaches on a rainy day ... I swung, the blood spurted. This is the only baptism I remember.

There was a peace in me, something like fibers untwining, and the landscape was sweet, maternal, like a reflection on the water, and it had a measure, a decency, a restraint at the same time as an abandonment, the landscape, a friendship at last ... my blood no longer swore, something like an undoing and a blooming.

I too can read and the cloud over the head of the old negro that I saw on the breaking wheel on a square in Cape Town, he slapped a White, I was 10 years old, the low sky is a damper, the wind swells with burdens and the sobs of sweating skin, the wind is contaminated with whips and casks and the hung populate the sky with orchis and there are mastiffs with bloody hair and ears ... ears ... boats

- I am The Great Prohibitor, do you understand?

Remember this name, don Alonzo de Hojeda; just as history has remembered his iconic gesture, offering the cacique Caonabo the most valuable thing in the world.

Isaac!

- {:.sp} The Narrator.

Merci, ma mère. Et il fallait aussi — n'est ce pas ? — à ceux qui t'ont envoyée, il leur fallait mieux que ma défaite, mieux que ma poitrine qui se rompt, mieux que mon sang qui se décompose, il leur fallait mon acceptation ... il leur fallait mon oui et alors ils t'ont envoyée ... Va t'en marâtre ... va t'en car je t'exècre ... va t'en les mains vides ... ou plutôt prends&nbsp;ce sac de paroles ... les paroles de Toussaint, les dernières peut-être, les dernières ... sans doute et porte les à ton engeance fienteuse.
