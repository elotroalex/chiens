  <h1>playbill.</h1>

<p>During the height of the fascist Vichy regime in Martinique, Aimé Césaire was secretly working on a forceful historical drama with the title “...... Et les chiens se taisaient”—"...... And the Dogs Were Silent." The plot of the drama follows the events of the Haitian Revolution and the tragic destiny of its leader, Toussaint L’Ouverture, determined to die betrayed in a frozen cell in the Jura mountains rather than compromise his truth. The typescript could’ve cost Césaire his livelihood—if not more—had it been found by the Vichy authorities. But smuggled truth under fascism is only half of the story. After the war, in 1946, when fascism was replaced with liberal colonialism, history and theater receded from the text, the blows softened, and the line “<em>mort aux blancs</em>,” kill the whites, rephrained 69 times in the original typescript, was reduced to one hesitant appearance in the PG-13 oratorio published in Paris for a bruised audience—the text familiar to readers today. As with most famous attempts at presenting black armies decimating white armies, history didn’t find its proper stage.</p>

<p>In 2019, the insistence of racism and colonialism summon again their inevitable corollary, a virulent fascism. In these ulcerous times, I hope this other Césaire—singing the surrealism of unapologetic black victory and defiance—can be a source of welcome reflection and jolt.</p>
